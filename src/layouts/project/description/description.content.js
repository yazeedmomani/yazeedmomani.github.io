      'The company "Josor Steels" needed a new website to replace their old one. They also needed someone to redraw their logo so that it is scalable. I was tasked with designing the website, redrawing its logo, and developing it.',
      "I redrew the logo using Adobe Illustrator with a light background, a dark background, and a transparent background and exported it in different formats including SVG, PNG, and ICO. Then, I proceeded by designing the website using Adobe XD. After that, I developed the website using ReactJS, taking the mobile-first approach.",
